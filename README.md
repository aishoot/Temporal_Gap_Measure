# Temporal Gap Detection Experiment
Time resolution measurement experiments of noise with different cut-off frequency and bandwidth.


### 1.1 Time resolution
It characterizes the auditory system's ability to detect time-varying characteristics of stimulus signals.

### 1.2 Narrowband noise mute detection method
Add silent segments to band-limited noise to measure the minimum length of silence that can be detected by the auditory system.

### 1.3 Experimental purpose
The time resolution of different conditions (different bandwidths and frequency ranges of the noise) is measured by the method of narrowband noise mute detection

### 1.4 Reference
"The detection of temporal gaps as a function of frequency region and absolute noise bandwidth" (Eddins et al., 1992)
