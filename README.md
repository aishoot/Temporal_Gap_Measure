## Time resolution
It characterizes the auditory system's ability to detect time-varying characteristics of stimulus signals.

## Narrowband noise mute detection method
Add silent segments to band-limited noise to measure the minimum length of silence that can be detected by the auditory system.

## Experimental purpose
The time resolution of different conditions (different bandwidths and frequency ranges of the noise) is measured by the method of narrowband noise mute detection
